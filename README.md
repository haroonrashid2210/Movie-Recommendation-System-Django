### The Movie Data Base - TMDB API
I have used TMDB API to fetch movie details and to fetch posters. In order to do that an API key is
required which I get after creating account on TMDB and place API key request.

If API key don't work then register in TMDB and apply for API key. The API key used in the project is from my personal account.
